Basic concepts to understand
NFTs: Non Fungible Tokens, let's imagine them much like the products category we have on amazon. 

Example, Washing Machines: There are 1,000s of different unique washing machines on amazon, each with a different price.

This is similare to how NFT projects work, there are 1000s of NFTs in a project.
Each NFT is unique, owned by different individuals.

Just like sellers can list their Washing machines for any price on amazon, owners of NFTs can do the same.
If I have an NFT, i can choose to list it for any price.

If someone finds it a good deal, they can buy.

Due to this nature, prices of NFTs under a project are constantly changing by users.

Our customers are people who are interested in buying these NFTs / Washing Machines. We have to help them find the best deal in realtime.


======================
Now to the first challenge
=====================

Read object: "last_listing_update.json"
This object contains listings of a project upto certain time. Our goal is to fetch listings that happened after that and merge it with the response from above URL.

Variables
-contract_address : This is a unique identifier for each project
-token_ids : IDs to identify each washing machine. This is unique for every NFT.
-listing_times : EPOCH time when each listing happened.
-expiration_times : expire time of the listing (after this it'll be invalid)
-prices : price of the listing
-from_addresses - Ignore this
-last_trade_events ignore this 
-synced_at: time when this object was last updated



Goals:
1. We have to identify listings that happened after the previous object was last updated (syned_at) using "fb_contract_address_listings.json.json"
Merge it into the abover object and save / log the result.

2. Each token can have multiple listing in the JSON file, we have to find the cheapest listing by price and add it.
